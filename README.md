# Backend-Blog-API
Wrote a backend API using Python and Flask to fetch data from a blog post API and return a JSON object with an array of blog posts given certain query parameters.

Sped up program execution by caching responses and making concurrent requests to the API. 

Tested application using Pythonâ€™s unittest framework.
